 * The ticket contains the person's name, phone number, email address or other custom fields.

 * Tickets belong to lines.
 * Tickets can have many TicketExtras.

 * If the location has SMS enabled, some visitors may exchange messages with the location. Those

 *
 * To create a Ticket, call {@link TicketService.create}.
 * To search for tickets, call {@link TicketService.search}.
